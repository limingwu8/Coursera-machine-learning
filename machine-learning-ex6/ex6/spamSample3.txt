Dear Liming,

As I have not heard from you since my last follow-up, I want to
make sure that everything is going well with your evaluation of
SecureCRT for Windows.

Since you indicated one of your goals is to increase the
productivity of your IT staff, I want to make sure you're aware
of just some of the features in SecureCRT for Windows that are geared toward
your goal.  These include scripting, keymapping, button bar,
command window, plus many others.

Are you looking for specific capabilities in this area?  I'd be
happy to send you more details on how these and other features
may help you in your specific environment.


Sincerely,
